## Installation

Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/clebercoutof/mixcell
```

Run the shell script to install the Dynamixel SDK, case there is an error follow the instructions 
in the prerequisites.

Go to the installation folder and run install.sh

```
$ cd mixcell/install/
```

```
$ ./install.sh
```
It's necessary to give your user permanent permissions do access the usb port, so

```
$ cd mixcell/install/
```

```
$ ./reinstall.sh
```


### Prerequisites
It's necessary to install the linux64 C library of [Dynamixel SDK Version 3.5.4](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK/releases/tag/3.5.4) and the PyQT4. 

You can find the complete installation guide for the SDK [here](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_sdk/overview/)

Download the file and extract in the desired folder

```
$ cd ~/foo/DynamixelSDK-3.4.3/c/build/linux64
```

* Build the library

```
$ make
```

* Case there is an error

```
$ make clean
```

* And

```
$ make
```
* Install the library

```
$ sudo make install
```

* Case there is an error

```
$ sudo make reinstall

In order to install PyQT4
```
$ apt-cache search pyqt
```

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-qt4
```

## Code Maintenance and intelectual property

This tool was developed as one of my activites during the internetship in the [Brazilian Institue of Robotics](https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics) at [Senai CIMATEC](http://www.senaicimatec.com.br/).

The code is oficially maintened by the institution, but feel free to use this repository as a tool to communicate.
